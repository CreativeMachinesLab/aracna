ARACNA - An Open Source Robotics Platform Evolutionary Algorithm Development
============================================================================
Aracna is a platform for developing evolutionary algorithms in the real world.  A host computer evolves gaits, and the aracna robot is able to test them.  Note that Aracna is still a work in progress.
