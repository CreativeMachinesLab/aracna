ARACNA
======
**_An Open Source Robotics Platform for Evolutionary Algorithm Development_**  
Aracna is a platform for developing evolutionary algorithms in the real world.  A host computer evolves gaits, and the aracna robot is able to test them.  Note that Aracna is still a work in progress, and this repo is subject to frequent change.  You can find legacy code and learning algorithms here: https://github.com/yosinski/QuadraTot/tree/aracna

For photos and the design files necessary to 3D print Aracna, see the related [aracnaHardware](https://github.com/yosinski/aracnaHardware) repository. For more pictures of the printed robot and more details of the Aracna project, see http://creativemachines.cornell.edu/aracna. You can also [watch a video of Aracna being 3D printed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11jYG45HGuo) or read an articles about Aracna by [Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/3005313/evolved-brains-robots-creep-closer-animal-learning) or [Servo Magazine](http://servo.texterity.com/servo/201306?pg%3D47%26search_term%3Daracna%23pg47#pg1).
