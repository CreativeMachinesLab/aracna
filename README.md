ARACNA
======
**_An Open Source Robotics Platform for Evolutionary Algorithm Development_**  
Aracna is a platform for developing evolutionary algorithms in the real world.  A host computer evolves gaits, and the aracna robot is able to test them.  Note that Aracna is still a work in progress, and this repo is subject to frequent change.  You can find legacy code and learning algorithms here: https://github.com/yosinski/QuadraTot/tree/aracna
