Command list for Aracna rebase.

position and velocity will have values in the range [0,1023]
positions, velocities, etc will use up to 4 bytes (ie. literal strings such as "423" or "1023")

might want to include a checksum in the future...

Hello:
	PC sends ".h" "\n"
	Board replies ".h" "\n"
Query:
	PC sends ".q" "\n"
	ArbotiX replies ".q" <CSV board state> "\n"
		<CSV board state> = <other info here...?>,<servo0_position>,<servo1_position>...
Command position:
	PC sends ".c" <goal position vector> "\n"
		<goal position vector> = <servo0_position>,<servo1_position>...
	ArbotiX replies ".c" <current position vector> "\n"
Set servo speed:
	PC sends ".v" <speed vector>  "\n"
		<speed vector> = <servo0_speed>,<servo1_speed>...
	ArbotiX replies ".v" <current speed vector> "\n"
Set servo torque:
	PC sends "t" <motor#> "," <torque> "\n"
	ArbotiX replies ".t" <motor#> "," <current torque> "\n"
