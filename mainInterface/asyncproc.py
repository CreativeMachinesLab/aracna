       Parameters:
        - timeout        The time, in seconds, the function is allowed to spend.
                        This must be an integer, due to limitations in the
                        SIGALRM handling.
        - func                The function to call.
        - *args                Non-keyword arguments to pass to func.
        - **kwargs        Keyword arguments to pass to func.

       Upon successful completion, with_timeout() returns the return value

       If an alarm is pending when with_timeout() is called, with_timeout()
       tries to restore that alarm as well as possible, and call the SIGALRM
       signal handler if it would have expired during the execution of func.
       This may cause that signal handler to be executed later than it would
       normally do.  In particular, calling with_timeout() from within a
       with_timeout() call with a shorter timeout, won't interrupt the inner
       call.  I.e.,
            with_timeout(5, with_timeout, 60, time.sleep, 120)
       won't interrupt the time.sleep() call until after 60 seconds.

       The process will be run in the background, and its standard output

       Since the collection of output happens asynchronously (handled by
       threads), the process won't block even if it outputs large amounts
       of data and you do not call Process.read*().

       Similarly, it is possible to send data to the standard input of the
       process using the write() method, and the caller of write() won't
       block even if the process does not drain its input.

       On the other hand, this can consume large amounts of memory,
       potentially even exhausting all memory available.

       Parameters are identical to subprocess.Popen(), except that stdin,
       stdout and stderr default to subprocess.PIPE instead of to None.
       Note that if you set stdout or stderr to anything but PIPE, the
       Process object won't collect that output, and the read*() methods
       will always return empty strings.  Also, setting stdin to something
       other than PIPE will make the write() method raise an exception.
